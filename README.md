# *My Fitness Tracker*

##**Overview** :
 My fitness calculator enables user to track their food intake throughout the day. It will allow the user to add 
their food with their respective macros and can add food into the various meals throughout the day. It will help the
people to track their daily intake on the daily basis. This project interests me because it helps people 
 to track their calorie and as well as macros intake.
