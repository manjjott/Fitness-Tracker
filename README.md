# *My Fitness Tracker*

##**Overview** :
 My fitness calculator enables user to track their food intake throughout the day. It will allow the user to add 
their food with their respective macros and can add food into the various meals throughout the day. It will help the
people to track their daily intake on the daily basis. This project interests me because it helps people 
 to track their calorie and as well as macros intake.




## **User stories (Phase 1)**:
<ol>
<li>As a user should be able to <strong> make food </strong> along with their respective macros. </li>
<li>As a user should be able to <strong> add food </strong> into breakfast, lunch and dinner list. </li>
<li> As a user should be able to <strong> delete food </strong> from breakfast, lunch and dinner list. </li>
<li>As a user should be able to <strong> check my daily calories </strong>.</li>
<li>As a user should be able to <strong> view my breakfast, lunch and dinner list </strong>.</li>
</ol>

## **User stories (Phase 2)**:
<ol>
<li>As a user I should be able to <strong>save food</strong> as the breakfast, lunch and dinner list.</li>
<li>As a user I should be able to <strong>load food</strong> as the breakfast, lunch and dinner list.</li>
</ol>


## **Phase 4 : Task 3
One thing that I would like to refactor is doing exception handling in my project. For example, a user may add similar
food but with different nutrition value in that case it must give an exception. Also, one thing I would like to improve 
is that user must be able to burn calories with having an additional exercise class.
